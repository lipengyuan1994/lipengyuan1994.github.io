...For example, you could have &lsquo;not fun,&rsquo; which of course, is the opposite of &lsquo;fun,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why sequence models are very important in NLP.


...Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given the word or phrase, and you would learn to build a poetry generator.


...However, from my point of view, the knowledge given in this course is too&nbsp;basic, there are so many things that NLP can do, like a&nbsp;chatbot.   Because the target student of this specialization is SDEs, I think this course should definitely include more advanced NLP applications and also should&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;the time with basic pieces of knowledge such as: how to tokenize works.&nbsp;]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A thorough review of Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence&#x2c; Machine Learning&#x2c; and Deep Learning &#x7c; deeplearning.ai</title><dc:creator>patrick li</dc:creator><category>Data Science</category><category>MOOC</category><dc:date>2019-11-30T23:13:10-05:00</dc:date><link>https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/ad158cba43d512e8257effbe03c04b2d-1.html#unique-entry-id-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/ad158cba43d512e8257effbe03c04b2d-1.html#unique-entry-id-1</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[If the students don&rsquo;t know about deep learning, it would be a little bit hard to understand that the code is really doing.   Because this course is more on practice but doesn&rsquo;t cover too much theory foundations, for example, it wouldn&rsquo;t teach you how to calculate the size of the conventions and pooling layers in detail, but the instructor will provide a link to a specific course.   Let me illustrate this by example: in the week2 video, when Laurence Moroney taught using TensorFlow to build convolutional NN, he provided a link to a lecture in the fourth course of DeepLearningSpecialization.


...However, from my point of view, the knowledge of deep learning is also required if you want to get understood what the codes are really doing.   If you already finished DeepLearningSpecialization or you already know the fundamental theories in deep learning, but not familiar with TensorFlow, I would recommend this course to you; If you use PyTorch before and want to get your hand dirty with TensorFlow, I would recommend this to you; If you are an ambitious data enthusiast like me, I would definitely recommend this course to you too! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Thorough Review of Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan</title><dc:creator>patrick li</dc:creator><category>Data Science</category><category>MOOC</category><dc:date>2019-11-28T23:13:54-05:00</dc:date><link>https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/ecfd231eaacd0fd26db7102d4762a619-2.html#unique-entry-id-2</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/ecfd231eaacd0fd26db7102d4762a619-2.html#unique-entry-id-2</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[Posted in Toward Data Science in Medium
