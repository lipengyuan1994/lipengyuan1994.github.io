...The knowledge point of this course(Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow) is organized in strict chronological order as to how the instructor designed this course. 

...What you see below is what you can get from this course.


...In these projects, you would have a chance to practice what you have learned in the first week.


...Today in the world of applied NLP, word embeddings have proved to be one of the most powerful and useful ideas to help teams get excellent performance.


Moroney mentioned that there&rsquo;s a library called TensorFlow Data Services or TFDS for short, and that contains many data sets and lots of different categories.


...		You would learn how to train a classification neural network from scratch with Tensorflow, Numpy, and Pandas.


...		You would learn how to plot the result and understand the performance of your NN


		The most interesting I learned this week is how to pull out the embedding layer and use projector.tensorflow.org to visualize your word embeddings.


...Sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear.   For example, you could have &lsquo;not fun,&rsquo; which of course, is the opposite of &lsquo;fun,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why sequence models are very important in NLP.


...		The exercise this week is for helping the student to explore overfitting in NLP and find the reason of overfitting.


...Week4 Laurence talked about the prediction in NLP, which is text generation.   Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given the word or phrase, and you would learn to build a poetry generator.


...As the third course in Tensorflow in Practice Specialization, Laurence goes through all necessary NLP skills and tricks with Tensorflow and Keras.


However, from my point of view, the knowledge given in this course is too&nbsp;basic, there are so many things that NLP can do, like a&nbsp;chatbot.   Because the target student of this specialization is SDEs, I think this course should definitely include more advanced NLP applications and also should&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;the time with basic pieces of knowledge such as: how to tokenize works.&nbsp;  For anyone who wants to learn the basic knowledge, he should finish Andrew&rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialization at first.


As usual, you can find all the materials in&nbsp;my Github repo.   This is a treasure repo, and welcome to contribute this repo if you are also a life-long learner like me.

...		The relationship between this course and Deep Learning Specialization


...This course is the first course in TensorFlow in Practice Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai.   It is an introduction to TensorFlow as the course name implies it.   Intermediate Level, and will lead you to dive into deep learning/ computer vision/ artificial intelligence.


...The relationship between this course and Deep Learning Specialization


I would say deep learning specialization is somehow like a prerequisite for this course.   If the students don&rsquo;t know about deep learning, it would be a little bit hard to understand that the code is really doing.   Because this course is more on practice but doesn&rsquo;t cover too much theory foundations, for example, it wouldn&rsquo;t teach you how to calculate the size of the conventions and pooling layers in detail, but the instructor will provide a link to a specific course.   Let me illustrate this by example: in the week2 video, when Laurence Moroney taught using TensorFlow to build convolutional NN, he provided a link to a lecture in the fourth course of DeepLearningSpecialization.


...It requires students to have experience in Python coding and high school-level math.   It says, &ldquo;Prior machine learning or deep learning knowledge is helpful but not required.&rdquo;   However, from my point of view, the knowledge of deep learning is also required if you want to get understood what the codes are really doing.   If you already finished DeepLearningSpecialization or you already know the fundamental theories in deep learning, but not familiar with TensorFlow, I would recommend this course to you; If you use PyTorch before and want to get your hand dirty with TensorFlow, I would recommend this to you; If you are an ambitious data enthusiast like me, I would definitely recommend this course to you too!   If you are are interested in this course and searching the information about this course and, then don&rsquo;t hesitate, this course is designed for you.


...Laurence Moroney&rsquo;s teaching style is charming, not the same as your professor or other courses provided by Universities. ...  Besides, I love the talks between Laurence and Andrew at the beginning of every week&rsquo;s lecture.   The coding assignments are not challenging, and modesty aside, they are kind of easy for me ( I already finished Andrew&rsquo;s Deep learning Specialization).   Laurence also provided codes in google colab, and it just makes the learning process much more manageable, students can train and test the models in colab very quickly.


And as usual, you can find all materials of this course in my GitHub repo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Thorough Review of Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan</title><dc:creator>Patrick Li</dc:creator><category>Data Science</category><category>Mooc</category><dc:date>2019-11-28T09:12:24-05:00</dc:date><link>https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/0461cce2d67cfa4c1a900cfd011ad403-5.html#unique-entry-id-5</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://lipengyuan1994.github.io/blog/files/0461cce2d67cfa4c1a900cfd011ad403-5.html#unique-entry-id-5</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[Posted in Toward Data Science in Medium

It is the time for me to carry on this awesome traditions of self-teaching data scientists. 


	&bull;	I need a fully-functional repository  to put all my important things together: my all kinds of blogs, learning resources&hellip;.   Using services provided by Blogger or Medium can not satisfy all my needs, and WordPress Pro & Wiz is too expensive. 


But if you want to start building your first blog, WordPress free account might be a good choice for you.
